  <h2 class='c006'>INTRODUCTION.</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_1_0_8 c007'>To preserve the lives and health
of the inferior part of mankind
has been an object
carefully attended to in all civilized
and well regulated states, not only
from motives of compassion, but
because it has been plainly demonstrated
that it is the interest of the
wealthy in every nation to encourage
population, and provide for the wants
of the poor.</p>

<p class='c008'>One would indeed, on the first
thought presume, that the unavoidable
necessities of the indigent would
be voluntarily relieved out of the
abundance of their opulent neighbours;
but the number of laws that
have been made for the provision of
the poor, are proofs of the futility
of this expectation, and the necessity
of compulsion.</p>

<p class='c008'>Among the many objects that
have been provided for, it seems
matter of astonishment that no one
has ever pointed out the Small Pox
as a distemper, whose destructive
consequences might be in great measure
prevented by the interposition of
Legislature, and the assistance that
would be certainly afforded from
private charity.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is now above fifty years since
Inoculation was introduced into this
country, and like other new institutions
was then opposed; but at
present, though it may be impossible
to define the numbers that are yearly
inoculated, it is certain that most of
the wealthy approve and avail themselves
of the practice: yet we view
the Bills of Mortality with unconcern,
though they demonstrate that
the number of deaths from this disease
is considerably increased; and
with the affecting circumstance, that
they are probably of the younger
part of the people.</p>

<p class='c008'>Although this matter has not been
attended to here, it did not escape
the penetration of the Empress of
Russia; who, with a regard to the
happiness of her people that deserves
much greater commendation than I
am able to bestow, was extremely
solicitous to render Inoculation general
among her subjects: and it was
with a view to this that soon after
the recovery of the Empress and
Grand Duke from this operation,
her Majesty was pleased to command
me to write their cases, with the
principal occurrences during the Inoculation,
from an idea that being
published they would tend to the
removal of prejudices, and the advancement
of a practice she had
much at heart to encourage.</p>

<p class='c008'>Her Imperial Majesty also frequently
did me the honor to converse
freely on several points respecting
the natural Small Pox and Inoculation;
and having been pleased to
approve of the manner in which her
enquiries and doubts were answered,
I was afterwards commanded at different
times to give in writing the
substance of what had been advanced
on these occasions. These orders
were obeyed, the tracts translated
into the Russian language, and as I
imagined, were only intended for
the perusal of the Empress. But
in the year 1770, my treatise on
Inoculation, with the following tracts,
was published at Petersburg by her
Majesty’s command:</p>

<p class='c009'>I. An Account of the Inoculation
for the Small Pox of her Imperial
Majesty, Autocratrix of all the
Russias.</p>

<p class='c009'>II. An Account of the Inoculation
for the Small Pox of his Imperial
Highness the Grand Duke, the
Heir of all the Russias, by Baron
Thomas Dimsdale, first Physician
to her Imperial Majesty.</p>

<p class='c009'>III. Remarks on the Book, intitled,
The present Method of Inoculating
for the Small Pox, written
by the Author now at St. Petersburg.</p>

<p class='c009'>IV. A short Description of the Methods
proposed for extending the
salutary Practice of Inoculation
through the whole Russian Empire.</p>

<p class='c009'>V. A short Estimate of the Numbers
of those who die of the natural
Small Pox, with a View to
demonstrate the Advantages that
may accrue to Russia from the
Practice of Inoculation, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c008'>A translation of these tracts, with
some further remarks on Inoculation,
and a relation of my journey to
Russia, has been preparing for the
Press; but on some accounts unnecessary
to be entered on here, is deferred.</p>

<p class='c008'>Indeed, my appearance as a writer
now is earlier than I intended, on
account of a plan that I have seen
of a Dispensary for inoculating the
poor of London at their own houses,
in which some plausible reasons for
such an establishment are advanced;
but I think they are much more
specious than substantial; and that
the plan itself is fraught with very
dangerous consequences to the community,
and not like to answer any
good purpose if put in execution.
Wherefore I thought it a duty owing
to the public to publish these sentiments
on the subject, that none
should inadvertently misapply their
charity so as to do mischief when
good was intended.</p>

<p class='c008'>In pursuance of this design, it
seemed not improper to begin with
the two last of the tracts that were
wrote at Petersburg in the year 1768,
as my opinions on the subjects treated
of remain the same as at that time.
But I desire that what is advanced in
them, or may be found in the sequel,
that tends to discountenance the
practice of Inoculation by persons
who have not had a medical education,
may not be construed as a design
to affect any of the family to
whose mode of practice Inoculation
is indebted for some considerable
improvements; nothing can be farther
from my intention, for I have
been at all times disposed to do them
justice, and allow all the merit that
is their due.</p>

<p class='c008'>In fact, I am an advocate for
Inoculation; and wish the design of
extending the benefit to the poor
may be so conducted, as to afford
its enemies as few opportunities of
objecting to it on any solid ground
as possible; and that the affair may
be so well understood, as to make it
plain in what manner charitably disposed
persons may most usefully employ
their benevolence.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c006'>A Description of the<br /> <br />METHODS<br /> <br />PROPOSED</h2>
</div>

<p class='c011'>For extending the salutary practice
of Inoculation through the whole
Russian Empire.</p>

<p class='c009'><i>Written at Petersburg by her Imperial Majesty’s
first Physician Baron</i> <span class='sc'>Thomas
Dimsdale</span>.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_1_0_8 c007'>In obedience to the orders received
from her Imperial Majesty,
I shall endeavour to demonstrate
in a clear and concise manner the destructive
effects of the Small Pox in the natural
way, and the safety and advantage of
Inoculation, even when performed after the
old manner; and afterwards exhibit the
improvement of the method, being the
same which is now introduced into this
great empire.</p>

<p class='c008'>It will not be in my power to execute
this plan with the accuracy I could wish,
being engaged in an employment that demands
much time and attention. But I
will use my best endeavours to describe in
the first place a method of propagating
the practice of Inoculation, so that it may
not be dangerous to those in the neighbourhood,
who, either on account of bad
health, age, prejudice, or other reasons,
are unwilling to submit to the operation,
and at the same time render it salutary to
such as are proper objects and approve of
it.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is not to be supposed that the method
now practised in England so successfully,
can be received in Russia without some alteration.
The experiments however which
I have made in England, in order to ascertain
the most commodious manner of
conducting the affair, may be of use here;
which I shall therefore describe as clearly
as possible. &nbsp;&nbsp;* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class='c008'>In the original published in Russia, there
followed a circumstantial account of the
house I had built for the accommodation
of my patients in England, and the manner
of conducting the process, &amp;c. there;
which, as it would be of no consequence
or use to insert in this translation, I have
omitted.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class='c008'>One, and indeed no inconsiderable advantage
derived from a plan of this sort
is, that by collecting all the patients together
in one house, the physician will be
enabled to attend a great number at the
same time in a proper manner, and also
to pay particular attention to such as may
more immediately require his assistance.</p>

<p class='c008'>And it is of no small importance to
those who have been inoculated, that the
necessary regulations in respect to regimen,
as well as every other circumstance
that requires the physician’s attention,
may here be properly observed.</p>

<p class='c008'>There is likewise another advantage obtained
by this method, that, with proper
caution, the Small Pox will not be communicated
to others in the natural way of
infection.</p>

<p class='c008'>Notwithstanding all these conveniencies
it will doubtless happen here, as it did in
my neighbourhood, that many persons of
distinction will rather prefer the inoculation
of their families at their own houses.
In this case it is submitted to the wisdom
of government, whether it would not be
proper to give orders that such persons
should give public notice of their intention
to inoculate, mentioning the time
when the operation is to be performed,
and also of their perfect recovery. By
these means such as have not had the
Small Pox, will have it in their power to
avoid the infection.</p>

<p class='c008'>So much with regard to the accommodation
of persons of rank, who may be
inoculated under one or the other abovementioned
regulations. But the poor cannot
enjoy those advantages. Humanity
however and the interest of the state
equally demand, that all possible attention
should be bestowed for their assistance and
preservation.</p>

<p class='c008'>In order to attain this end, I know of
no better or more certain method than that
which I followed, on charitable motives
only, in my own neighbourhood, by
inoculating all the inhabitants of a village
who had never had the Small Pox, on the
same day: and, if this be performed in
a proper manner, they might be all duly
visited, and proper medicines administered
at a moderate expence, and the whole be
over in about three weeks: after which,
this village would have nothing to apprehend
from the Small Pox for some years.
According to this plan, it will be unavoidably
necessary that every child should
be inoculated for the Small Pox soon after
its birth, or that inoculation should be
performed in every town or village once in
five or six years. This last method I
would rather recommend, and therefore,
in order to make this proposal perfectly
intelligible, I shall endeavour to explain
it more particularly.</p>

<p class='c008'>A list of the names and ages of such
inhabitants of every town and village as
have not had the Small Pox, is the first
necessary step to be taken; and marks
should be made against the names of those
who on account of their ill state of health,
or other reasons, are not thought fit subjects
for the operation in the judgment of
the inoculator; and such persons should
be provided with a separate place of abode,
where they may not be in danger of receiving
the infection: the rest should be
collected together in one place, inoculated
at one time, and proper medicines, with
directions specifying the time and manner
in which they are to be taken, should be
distributed to each individual. On the
fourth day after the inoculation they should
again be assembled together, the punctures
examined, and such farther medicines
given as the inoculator may think proper.
After the seventh the patients should be
examined daily; for from that time to the
eleventh, or perhaps fourteenth, is a period
that requires more particular attention.
During the whole of this time, and indeed
throughout the whole process, the sick
may continue at their own houses. And
it may be reasonably presumed, that there
will be a sufficient number of such as are
but slightly indisposed, who may be able
to assist the others, so as to make the expence
and trouble of nurses unnecessary.
But we must also suppose, that of the very
great number inoculated there will be some
who may have the disease severely, or
whose cases may require more constant attendance
than they can possibly have at
their own habitations. To provide for
such extraordinary instances, therefore, a
proper house and other conveniencies
should be previously appointed, to which
they should be removed when thought necessary.</p>

<p class='c008'>It will be impossible to determine precisely
how many patients may want such
attendance, and consequently difficult to
provide exactly the necessary accommodations;
but I imagine there will not be
more than four or five out of one hundred.</p>

<p class='c008'>The diet of all should consist of vegetables,
milk, bread, and the like; and in
some cases a little mutton-broth may be
allowed. The drink should be nothing
but water, unless by the particular direction
of the inoculator.</p>

<p class='c008'>But in order to secure the observance of
this regimen more exactly, all salted provision
and every kind of strong liquor
ought to be removed from the place, and
every necessary precaution taken to prevent
the patients from procuring any. In respect
to medicines, the prescriptions being
agreed on by the faculty, a sufficient quantity
should be prepared, and proper doses;
agreeable to the different age and constitution,
put up separately, and distributed by
the inoculator among the patients, with
directions in what manner they should be
administered; and their recovery should be
completed with some proper purgative.</p>

<p class='c008'>A licence or exclusive permission ought
to be granted to such physicians or surgeons
as undertake to inoculate for the Small
Pox; for the mischief arising from the
practice of inoculation by the illiterate and
ignorant is beyond conception<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c012'><sup>[1]</sup></a>. Such
persons, instead of confining the infection
within narrow limits, too often, through
want of skill or honesty, are the means of
propagating it, to the great terror of many
people, the fatal consequences of which,
and the destructive tokens, remain in many
places in England. For besides the dreadful
mortality which the disease itself has
occasioned, it has often proved the source
of discord and contention among neighbours,
and disturbed that harmony and
friendship which had before subsisted among
the inhabitants.</p>

<hr class='c013' />
<div class='footnote' id='f1'>
<p class='c008'><span class='label'><a href='#r1'>1</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>To enumerate the instances that have happened
within my own knowledge to confirm this assertion,
would be almost endless; I shall only mention a few that
are remarkable.</p>

<p class='c008'>I was desired to visit a young woman about ten miles
distant; I found her dying from the inoculation of a
man, who, upon the credit of having been my coachman,
had set up inoculator: he was gone on the pretence
of procuring my assistance, but in fact had ran away;
this was his thirteenth patient.</p>

<p class='c008'>Another illiterate person in my neighbourhood began
the practice; but a child he had inoculated happening
to have a fit, he was so frighted as to elope till he was
informed that his patient was out of danger.</p>

<p class='c008'>I received a letter from a poor man who kept a school
about eight miles from Hertford, to inform me, that
not being able to pay a proper person, he had ventured to
inoculate his own family himself, and begging a visit on
account of one of his children who he feared was in
danger: I complied with his request, and found one
child dying of a confluent pock; but my compassion
abated, on finding his house filled with some poor neighbours
from whom he received a small gratuity for their
inoculation, one of which had lost an eye under his
care. This man’s residence was in a small town, and
from his patients several caught the Small Pox, and some
died.</p>

<p class='c008'>I saw a poor woman dying of a confluent disease; her
husband had raised money for his own inoculation, and
having had the disease favourably, was assured by a farmer
who inoculated him, that he might safely go home
to his family. The wife died, leaving five children,
who all had the disease and recovered.</p>

<p class='c008'>At a village not far from Hertford, the same farmer
inoculated as many of the parish as could raise five shillings
and three-pence, informing the others that the
Small Pox was not catching from the inoculated; but
the whole neighbourhood became infected, and several
died.</p>
</div>
<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c008'>To conclude, I beg this small treatise
may be considered only as an imperfect
sketch drawn up in haste; but if it should
be approved of, and her Imperial Majesty
be pleased to command me to enter into
farther particulars, I will employ my utmost
endeavours to render it more perfect,
and also assist in the execution of any part
of what has been therein proposed.</p>

<p class='c011'><i>A short estimate of the number of those who die
of the natural Small Pox, with a view to
demonstrate the advantages that may accrue
to Russia, from the practice of inoculation.</i></p>

<p class='c008'>It is needless to expatiate upon the havock
which the Small Pox makes in most
parts of the known world: probably there
is not a country, city, or smaller community,
which has not experienced its devastations
in its turn. The very idea of
it is insupportable; but its real effects, in
places unapprised and unacquainted with the
proper treatment and remedies against it,
are not less general and fatal than the
plague itself.</p>

<p class='c008'>Though this fact is generally allowed,
yet many, I think, are ignorant of the
immense loss mankind sustains by this
distemper. It may not be amiss therefore
to shew, from well attested accounts, the
proportion of persons who die of the natural
Small Pox: for which purpose it will
be necessary to chuse some country or city
where an exact register of the births and
deaths, as well as an accurate list of diseases,
is regularly kept.</p>

<p class='c008'>Dr. Jurin, secretary to the Royal Society
in London, carried this into execution
in 1722, soon after Inoculation had
been introduced into England, being desirous
of shewing the different effects of the
natural and inoculated Small Pox.</p>

<p class='c008'>I shall not here insert all that was published
by this ingenious author, as the
whole may be found in the Philosophical
Transactions of the Royal Society, under
Nᵒ 374. The following extract will be
sufficient for my present purpose.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Doctor for forty-two years selected
from the Bills of Mortality in London,
such as died there of the Small Pox and
other distempers. His observation may
appear perhaps somewhat extraordinary:
nevertheless he makes it plain, that out of
1000 infants, 386 die under two years of
age, which is considerably more than one
third. He then deducts such as he supposes
die of the diseases natural to infancy;
and afterwards proceeds to demonstrate,
that if the whole bulk of mankind be
taken at the age of two years, the eighth
part will die of the natural Small Pox;
and that of such as have it in the natural
way, one in five or six dies.</p>

<p class='c008'>With respect to my own calculations on
this subject, I endeavoured to find out
whether the Small Pox proved equally
fatal after the time mentioned by the
Doctor. With this view, before I left
England, I procured the Bills of Mortality
of the City of London for the last
thirty-four years, excepting two, which
could not be found. Of these I made a
table, which I have added at the end of
this treatise. I was surprized to find the
number for these thirty-two years past
tally so exactly with the observations made
by Dr. Jurin.</p>

<p class='c008'>On examining the table it appears, that
within these last thirty-two years 760,098
persons have died, and of those 268,529
have been infants under two years of age,
which agrees with Dr. Jurin’s calculation,
in being rather more than one-third of the
whole.</p>

<p class='c008'>I suppose, with Dr. Jurin, that the
deaths of these were occasioned by different
diseases incidental to infancy, and I deduct
them out of the whole number, viz.</p>

  </tr>
</table>

<p class='c008'>It appears likewise that in the same course
of time there died of the Small Pox
66,515, which confirms Dr. Jurin’s account,
and indeed exceeds the eighth part.
Hence we may fairly conclude, that in general
the Small Pox carried off the eighth
part of those who died in London in the
period abovementioned.  I procured also
the best accounts I possibly could of the
whole number of those who had had the
disease from places where the Small Pox
had raged most, and found, that near one
out of five died who had had the disease in
the natural way.  This also agrees with
Dr. Jurin’s observations.  We see then
that even in London, where the climate is
temperate, the disease well known, and
the treatment of the sick very ably conducted,
this single disease destroyed more
than the eighth part of the inhabitants.</p>

<p class='c008'>But if we turn our eyes towards other
dominions, and give credit to the accounts
told us, we shall find the disease still more
fatal, and in some cities it is almost as
destructive as the plague.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is impossible for me to ascertain with
any degree of certainty, the precise number
of persons who die annually of the
Small Pox in Russia. I am persuaded
however, both from good intelligence as
well as my own observations, that it is
exceeding fatal here. Though I cannot
confirm this assertion by proofs, yet from
some conversation with the learned I am
credibly informed, that of those who have
the Small Pox in the natural way one-half
die, including the rich and poor.</p>

<p class='c008'>It seems hardly necessary to shew, how
much the riches and strength of states depend
upon the number of inhabitants.
But perhaps there is not any country in
which the certainty of this position is more
indisputable than in Russia; for not only
the strength of the empire, but the riches
of every individual also, must be in proportion
to the degree of population.  If
therefore in London, which enjoys the
many advantages already recited, more
than 2000 persons die annually of the
Small Pox, we may surely suppose, that
the loss which Russia in its whole extent
sustains by this distemper in the same space
of time, amounts to two millions of souls.
And this havock must greatly retard the
increase of the human species.</p>

<p class='c008'>There are some diseases peculiar to old
age, which terminate a life almost entirely
spent, and totally useless to the community.</p>

<p class='c008'>Such diseases, considered in a political
sense, are not hurtful to the state. But
the Small Pox spreads destruction chiefly
upon the younger part of the species,
from whose labours in their several callings
the public might otherwise have expected
advantages beyond all computation. The
disappointment and loss incurred is of
course neither to be calculated nor conceived.</p>

<p class='c008'>A discourse upon this subject might be
extended to a great length; but it seems
unnecessary to enlarge, especially when I
consider to whose judgment this essay is
with all humility submitted.</p>

<p class='c008'>The public, I am persuaded, must be
sufficiently convinced from fact and demonstration,
that Inoculation is the only
means of preventing the mischiefs arising
from the Small Pox.</p>

<p class='c008'>In a former treatise I have laid down a
plan for an effectual method of general
practice, by which the spreading of the
natural Small Pox will be prevented, and
the cure of the inoculated rendered as easy
and safe as possible to the patient.</p>

<p class='c008'>I have therefore nothing more to add
but my wishes, that the empire of Russia
may meet with the utmost success from
this discovery, under the reign of so illustrious
and beneficent a Sovereign.</p>

  <h2 class='c006'>An objection to the practice of Inoculation considered.</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_1_0_8 c007'>From the time that Inoculation was
introduced into this country one may
date the opposition to its practice; many
learned and ingenious men soon entered
the field against it, and were encountered
by others of equal abilities in its defence.
The questions were warmly agitated, and
in a short time foreigners of great name
became authors on both sides. But the
strength of argument on the part of the
defenders of Inoculation, supported by the
good success of the practice, hath almost
silenced opposition; and the concurrence of
the courts of Petersburg, Vienna, and
France, who have submitted to the operation,
and by their illustrious examples encouraged
its progress in their dominions,
will probably close the dispute in its favour.</p>

<p class='c008'>One objection alone seems not to have
been satisfactorily removed, which, although
it does not relate to the safety or
health of the patient, is yet of great importance
to the community, and well deserves
the most attentive consideration.</p>

<p class='c008'>You have, say the objectors, produced
accurate and satisfactory accounts and calculations
of the alarming proportion of
deaths that happen from the natural Small
Pox, and also proved, that the loss sustained
under Inoculation is inconsiderable.
But admitting what you have advanced to
be true, whence comes it that the same
Bills of Mortality to which you appeal,
prove also a certain increase instead of a
diminution of deaths from the Small Pox,
and that for such a series of years as to
leave no room to dispute the fact? does it
not naturally follow, that though almost
the whole number of the inoculated recover,
the disease must have been spread by
their means, and a greater proportion
having taken the natural disease, a consequent
greater loss has been sustained by the
public? If the above is admitted, it will
be difficult to exculpate Inoculation from
having been hurtful to society<a id='r2' /><a href='#f2' class='c012'><sup>[2]</sup></a>.</p>

whereas before it was about one in eight.</p>

<p class='c008'>But if the eight years are divided, it will appear that
the deaths from the Small Pox in the first four years are
8642; the medium for each of those years will be
2160.</p>

<p class='c008'>For the last four years the numbers are 10179, the
medium for each 2544; an increase that is truly alarming,
and well deserving the attention of the public.—For
the <i>present</i> I shall forbear any remarks.</p>
</div>
<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c008'>Several attempts have been made to obviate
this objection, many of which I have
perused; but consistent with my intention
of brevity, and avoiding all controversy,
I shall decline entering into particulars, or
inserting any quotations from authors. It
will be sufficient to say, that although the
arguments advanced have been ingenious,
and in some respects just, they do not in
my apprehension remove the objection that
has been mentioned.</p>

<p class='c008'>Let us see then whether the practice may
not be fairly chargeable with some blame;
and this will appear more evidently, if we
take a view of the usual conduct of families
on such occasions; which however
pertinent to the question, seems hitherto
to have been avoided, or not attended to,
by the several writers on the subject.</p>

<p class='c008'>In London it has been the general
custom for those who intend to inoculate,
to take into account all the circumstances
that may be material for the conveniency
of their families and friends, and these
being settled to their minds, few precautions
are thought necessary respecting the
security of others: what passes previous
to the eruptive fever, does not claim our
consideration, since it is universally allowed
that no infection can be communicated
before that time; but it is after this
period the danger begins, and the disease
may be spread by the intercourse of visitants,
trades people, washerwomen, servants,
and others, and in a mild state of
the disease, the frequent excursions of the
sick by way of airings, and often in hired
carriages of various kinds, contribute
greatly towards spreading the infection.
It would perhaps be deemed a designed
omission, if the inoculators were not also
supposed to be of the number of those
that contribute to spread the disease.</p>

<p class='c008'>When all these circumstances are duly
considered, surely it will be allowed, that
the Small Pox is frequently caught from
the inoculated; and let it be remembered,
that whoever takes the disease from an
inoculated patient, has himself the natural
Small Pox, with all the circumstances of
danger in respect to his own life, and of
spreading the contagion to others.</p>

<p class='c008'>I know it has been said, and even publicly
declared, that the Small Pox from
Inoculation is so mild, as scarcely to be infectious
to others; but if this was true,
how comes it that matter, taken from
inoculated patients, conveys the distemper
with equal certainty, as if it was taken
from the natural Small Pox? is it not
morally certain, that the effluvia partake
of the same infectious quality? No physician
of any experience, I am sure, will
ever countenance such an opinion. But
lest it should prevail, and do mischief
among the ignorant and credulous, I think
it incumbent on me to contradict so dangerous
and unwarrantable an assertion.</p>

<p class='c008'>In fact, it is certain that the Small Pox
is infectious, in proportion to the number
and malignity of the pustules; so far
there is usually less danger from the artificial
disease, than from the natural. But
let not this presumption make any one remit
their care, or abate their concern for
the community; for I can assert from my
own knowledge, that<a id='r3' /><a href='#f3' class='c012'><sup>[3]</sup></a> many fatal instances
have happened from the disease having been
spread by the inoculated.</p>

</div>
<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c008'>Having considered the subject as fully
as I am able, it shall be left to the consideration
of the public without any comment;
only entreating every family that
may inoculate, to be extremely careful,
and use every possible precaution to prevent
spreading the infection during the illness,
and to be also particularly attentive, that
all furniture and cloaths be well aired.
The persons concerned in inoculating
should, on their parts, take great care that
they do not contribute to the mischief.</p>

<p class='c008'>If strict attention is paid to these particulars,
it may be reasonably hoped, that
the only remaining objection to the practice
of Inoculation in London among persons
of condition, may be much weakened, if
not entirely removed.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c006'>On general and partial Inoculations in the country.</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_1_0_8 c007'>The preceding translated treatises having
been calculated for Russia, which
in many circumstances differs from England,
and in particular that the will of the
Sovereign there is most implicitly obeyed,
cannot be expected to contain all that may
be necessary to be considered, and attended
to in this country.</p>

<p class='c008'>Nevertheless, the general principle of
the regulation, so far as it relates to public
Inoculation in towns and villages, may be
attended to, and of such places I mean to
treat first, and of London and other populous
places afterwards, for reasons that will
be sufficiently evident in the sequel.</p>

<p class='c008'>In order to be fully acquainted with the
subject, it seems necessary to take into
consideration, the mode of conducting this
affair in the country, which I do not remember
to have ever seen circumstantially
published; those who have wrote on the
subject, having for the most part contented
themselves with representations of their
success only.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the county of Hertford, there have
been two methods of public or general
Inoculation, one to inoculate, at a low price,
as many of the inhabitants of any small
town or village, as could be persuaded to
submit to it, and at the same time were
able to pay, refusing all those who had it
not in their power to procure the money
demanded.</p>

<p class='c008'>The other method has been, where the
inhabitants of a town, or district, of all denominations,
have agreed to be inoculated
at the same time, the parish officers, or
some neighbouring charitably disposed persons,
having first promised to defray the expence,
and provide subsistence for such of
the poor, as were unable to pay for themselves.</p>

<p class='c008'>The partial method first mentioned has
been attended by much mischief, and sufficiently
refuted the absurd opinion endeavoured
to be propagated by interested persons,
that inoculated persons do not communicate
infection; innumerable are the
instances which have happened of the disease
being caught from the inoculated,
and too evident to be denied; and so many
of these have died, that an opinion not less
absurd than the former prevails in Hertfordshire,
that those who take the Small
Pox from the inoculated rarely recover.</p>

<p class='c008'>The method of inoculating every one
in the same neighbourhood together has
succeeded so happily, that it seems only
necessary to determine what is the most
reasonable and frugal way of conducting
the business; and if joined to this consideration
proper attention is paid to airing
and cleansing the patients, their cloaths and
habitations, as much as possible, from the
power of infection, all the benefit that can
be derived from general Inoculation will
be effected, many valuable lives will be
preserved to the community, and the inhabitants
made happy, on being released
from the apprehensions of a visit from this
cruel disease.</p>

<p class='c008'>As I can from considerable experience
speak with some confidence on this subject,
I shall proceed to relate the observations
that have occurred to me. Assisted by my
learned friend Dr. Ingenhouz and my two
sons, I inoculated, at different times, the
neighbouring parishes of East Berkhamsted,
Hertingfordbury, Bayford, and the liberty
of Brickenden; in each of these places the
whole number of poor were inoculated,
with the exception of those who were objectionable.
I do not at present remember
the exact number, I believe they might be
more than 600; but know that they succeeded
happily, though there were several
very old persons, and women in different
periods of gestation; and this mode of
practice, as I have been informed, has
been also used successfully by many others
in different parts of England.</p>

<p class='c008'>So far as has come to my knowledge,
general Inoculations have hitherto been
confined to small towns and villages; yet
as the further extension is very much to be
wished, it may not be improper to relate
some particulars of what passed in Hertford,
which is doubtless the largest, and
most populous town, that has submitted to
the experiment of inoculating at the same
time the whole number of its inhabitants.</p>

<p class='c008'>In a former publication, I gave an account
of the occasion and success of a general
Inoculation at this place; from that
time the town was released from any apprehensions
of the disease, until the year
1770, when it appeared again, and two
or three having died, a few persons were
inoculated, and excited an alarm. On this
occasion, the poor in my neighbourhood
flocked in numbers, beseeching me to extend
to them the same charitable assistance,
they had formerly experienced; having then
my two sons with me to assist, I complied
without hesitation.</p>

<p class='c008'>Nothing shews the increase and state of
population so clearly, as an experiment of
this kind; we had then upwards of two
hundred and fifty patients, some of whom
were new inhabitants, but the rest consisted
for the most part of very young
children. Necessity has often produced
useful discoveries; the Inoculation was begun
on Midsummer-day, and though the
weather proved very hot, I observed no inconvenience
from it; they had the free use
of air, and seemed as much benefited by it
as at any other season of the year; and
every one recovered.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the year 1774 the disease appeared a
third time; the same request was renewed,
and with the same assistance afforded, the
whole town was inoculated once more,
and now the number amounted only to
about one hundred and twenty; from that
time we have heard nothing of Small Pox,
and I verily believe, that within these ten
years not six persons have died in Hertford
of this disease; whereas before the practice
was so generally adopted, the Small Pox
has frequently been epidemic and destroyed
a great number of the inhabitants, besides
injuring the market and trade of the town
for a considerable time.</p>

<p class='c008'>The inferences one may fairly draw
from these premises are, that in small
towns or villages, if some are inoculated
and others excluded, unless more precautions
are used than may reasonably be apprehended,
the consequence will be, that the
disease will spread through the vicinage,
and be fatal to many.</p>

<p class='c008'>On the contrary, if by general consent
a public Inoculation is agreed on, and the
poor are supplied with necessaries, the happiest
consequences may be reasonably expected;
and further, the good effect of repeated
general Inoculations in the town of
Hertford demonstrate, that large towns
may with great advantage avail themselves
of the same means, and, by occasionally
repeating the practice, be secured from the
ravages of this justly dreaded disease.</p>

<div class='pbb'>
 <hr class='pb c010' />
</div>
<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c006'>On general and partial Inoculations in London,<br />or other large and populous places.</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_1_0_8 c007'>It should be remarked, that what has hitherto
been said relates to the conduct of
this practice in villages and small towns,
who are capable of uniting in a general
plan for their common benefit. What I
next propose to consider is, how far a
practicable method can be adopted for general
Inoculation in London, or in other
large and populous places, where it is impossible
to obtain the consent of all the
inhabitants to be inoculated at one and
the same time.</p>

<p class='c008'>To be the more clearly understood, I
desire the distinction in the former part of
general and partial Inoculations may be remembered;
and that by the first I mean,
where the whole number of inhabitants of
any town or place are inoculated at the
same time, with the exception only of
such as are not in a proper state of health,
and those who may not chuse to submit to
that mode of receiving the disease. By
the second, where a part only of the inhabitants
are inoculated, and the remainder
left to take their chance of catching the
disease from their inoculated neighbours.</p>

<p class='c008'>The possibility of performing a general
Inoculation on all the inhabitants of this
city and suburbs at one time, will scarce
bear a moment’s consideration, so many
and so insuperable are the difficulties which
would occur in a free country. I shall
therefore decline entering upon the subject;
and quitting all thoughts of a general
practice, shall consider how far the inoculation
of such poor persons as may make
application for this purpose, can be complied
with in London, consistent with the
safety of themselves and others.</p>

<p class='c008'>It may reasonably be presumed, that the
greater number of these will be persons in
narrow circumstances, or in a state of poverty,
having nothing beforehand to support
an illness, and yet the whole family
who have not had the disease are to
be inoculated.  Whoever has visited the
abodes of the poor in and about London,
must allow the scene to be truly miserable;
their habitations in close alleys,
courts, and lanes, generally cold, dirty,
and in great want of necessaries, even of
bedding itself, a requisite of the greatest
use in time of sickness; there are frequently
several families under one roof; the men,
if industrious, employed in daily labour,
the women in washing and assisting in different
families, or waiting at markets to
carry little burdens as porters, and other
unavoidable employments abroad. None
of these can remit their occupations to attend
the sick, without exposing their families
to the distress which the want of the
little money their industry earned would
infallibly occasion; how or in what manner
are patients to be nursed and supplied
with food and necessaries during the illness,
or who is to be relied on, that the medicines
and diet enjoined by the person who
attends, shall be regularly complied with?</p>

<p class='c008'>Can any one be so inconsiderate as to
bring disease into a family before healthy,
without having first a reasonable expectation,
that what their situation may require
will certainly be provided? no one acquainted
with the general temper of parish
officers, will much depend on their assistance;
on the contrary, they will most
probably oppose the plan to the utmost of
their endeavours, from an apprehension
that the disease will be spread by these
means, and occasion a consequent increase
of expence to the parish.</p>

<p class='c008'>But admitting these objections could be
removed, one very important point, that
more immediately respects the security of
the patients and the public, should be attended
to.</p>

<p class='c008'>One great cause of the success that attends
the present practice, is supposed to
be the exposure of patients to fresh air;
and the more alarming the symptoms, the
greater is the necessity of administering
this salutary relief. The poor who are
inoculated in their own confined dwellings,
with perhaps many in family, will assuredly
require this reviving ventilation. They
have no gardens, areas, or the convenience
of carriages; are they to be carried or led
about the streets when ill, to the terror
and danger of the neighbourhood?</p>

<p class='c008'>Having suggested a few of the difficulties
that must ensue to the patients, it will
not be improper to consider, how far the
community will be likely to be affected by
the practice.</p>

<p class='c008'>To conduct the business of the Inoculation,
some place or places centrically situated
must be provided, at which the patients
should assemble in order to be inoculated,
and to which the several families of the
sick must have recourse for the necessary
medicines and directions during the distemper.
To find one or more such places in
the whole city, where the neighbourhood
would suffer an office of this kind to be
established, at which a great number of
the poor must be assembled at noon-day,
to receive an infectious and dangerous disease,
is hardly possible to conceive; and if
we consider that these persons must intermix
with others, who are attending to procure
the necessary medicines for their diseased
families, and who have been obliged
to make their way on foot through the
public streets, from every quarter of the
metropolis, in their infected apparel, the
public danger becomes great and inevitable.</p>

<p class='c008'>But should the poor who are proper to
undergo the operation be inoculated, and
means for their subsistence be provided,
questions will arise respecting the fate of
their neighbours, some of whom will be
precluded from the same advantage, by
being affected with other diseases, and others,
who have strong prejudices against it, will
be totally averse to the practice. Is it reasonable
to bring the Small Pox to the doors
of persons thus circumstanced, against their
consent? one shudders at the thought of
such an insult to humanity! But it is not
only the immediate neighbours that would
be endangered; to be well informed how
far the mischief might be extended, one
must take into account the situation and
conduct of the patients, and it may safely
be asserted from experience, that the following
would be found to be a true representation.</p>

<p class='c008'>The inoculated may be divided into two
classes. One in whom the distemper is so
mild as to admit the parties to go abroad;
the other, where the number of pustules is
so considerable as to confine the patients at
home; by far the greater number will be
of the first sort; and whatever orders may
be given to the contrary, it will be impossible
to restrain them from taking undue
liberties; the children who are of an age
for it will be found in the streets with
their former playfellows, and the men and
women who are able, will be endeavouring
to get into their former employments to
earn a little money, without regarding the
injury they may occasion to others. The
few who may be confined with a less favourable
disease, will infect the house and
their family, and the infection will be
spread from the gossiping disposition of the
poor, who are generally troublesome visitants,
to their sick neighbours, and after
all is over, the first sallying forth in their
infected cloaths is certain to add to the
mischief.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is unnecessary to dwell any longer on
the consequences of such a conduct to the
residents in such alleys; but there are
others who claim our regard.</p>

<p class='c008'>Country people who are obliged to come
to town to transact their business, and
others who bring their families to visit relations,
or to entertain them with the
pleasures of the town, are generally under
dreadful apprehensions of the Small Pox;
how would their fears and danger be increased,
if the poor were continually under
inoculation?</p>

<p class='c008'>Another thoughtless, but most useful
race of men, are well entitled to our best
endeavours for the preservation of their
healths and lives: I mean, sailors and sea-faring
men, of our own and other countries;
it is well known that our shores,
on both sides of the river, are continually
crouded with these, during their stay in
this country.</p>

<p class='c008'>Many of them have not had the Small
Pox, and their mode of living is the reverse
of due preparation; if Inoculation
should be practised in the houses of the
poor, it cannot be doubted that many of
these would catch this distemper?</p>

<p class='c008'>Is it possible to reflect without horror on
the situation of such of those unhappy
fellows, who should fall ill of the Small
Pox in the miserable lodgings they usually
inhabit, perhaps without a friend to take
the least care of them? or of the still
more calamitous state of others, who being
infected on shore should fall sick at sea,
where neither medicine nor proper attendance
can be had, and carry likewise with
them in their unwashed cloaths, the fatal
distemper into distant climates?</p>

<p class='c008'>I have been informed, that a child who
had received the infection was taken on
board an East Indiaman many years ago.
The disease was violent; the linen, &amp;c.
were put into a box, and carried to the
Cape of Good Hope: it was sent on shore;
the Small Pox immediately broke out in
the place, and carried off vast numbers of
the inhabitants.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the foregoing pages, some of the objections
to partial Inoculations of the poor
in this city have been stated; but the possibility
of extending the practice to any
good purpose, even if those objections were
removed, has not been taken notice of:
to elucidate this point, which is certainly
a material one, the following remarks are
submitted to consideration.</p>

<p class='c008'>The number of those who died of the
Small Pox in each of the last four years,
on an average is 2544.  To suppose that
one dies out of every six who have the natural
distemper, will be allowed a moderate
estimate: it follows then, that the number
of those who have passed through the disease
in each of the last four years will be
15,264. It will be impossible to determine
how many may remain uninfected; but if
we suppose that every year one out of eight
who have not had the disease is seized with
it, the remaining number who have not
had the Small Pox will be 122,112; and
it must be taken into account, that the annual
recruits by births will probably be
about 20,000, besides others that are continually
arriving out of the country to seek
employment.</p>

<p class='c008'>To form a scheme, however beneficial
to a few, that would probably spread the
disease, and involve so great a number of
others in a danger that they would otherwise
be much less exposed to, is an object
of great moment; and most certainly the
Legislature ought first to be consulted.</p>

<p class='c008'>Great liberty may be taken in our free
state; but we ought not to endanger the
public safety, because no legal provision is
made against it.</p>

  <h2 class='c006'>Of an Hospital for Inoculation.</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_1_0_8 c007'>If the objections that have been noticed
should be deemed of sufficient force to
set aside all thoughts of partial Inoculations
of the poor in London, what is to be done
will next become the question? It would
be cruel and unreasonable to refuse the
benefit of this discovery to the necessitous,
who on that very account are most
intitled to our assistance; yet how to provide
for them, consistent with the safety of
their neighbours, seems difficult, though I
hope not impracticable.</p>

<p class='c008'>A desire to see some expedient for this
purpose succeed, induces me to submit to
the consideration of the public, a proposal
that is in my apprehension liable to few objections,
and would best answer the purpose.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is to establish an Hospital for the purpose
of Inoculation only.</p>

<p class='c008'>I am aware that Hospitals have been
stigmatized as unhealthy, from the idea
that a number of sick persons confined together
corrupt the air, and generate contagious
putrid diseases. This charge has, I
think, been inconsiderately made, so far as
relates to Hospitals in and near this metropolis;
but as it is no part of my undertaking
to dispute the point, I shall confine
myself to what concerns an Hospital for
Inoculation, which, if every circumstance
is duly attended to, will be as little unhealthy
as any house in the kingdom.</p>

<p class='c008'>Let us for a moment drop the offensive
name of Hospital, and suppose a large
house is provided in a healthy situation,
with convenient and airy apartments for
the reception of any given number of persons
capable of being commodiously contained
in it; that to be in a good state of
health would be the necessary qualification
on the admission of every person, and about
three weeks the time of the residence;
and that the disease they are to undergo is
usually so mild, as to permit most of the
patients to be abroad in the open air almost
every day, and of a nature not to communicate
any putrid injury to others, except
its own specific poison. If to these circumstances
we add, that the patients will
in general be children and young persons,
that their cloaths and apartments will be
clean, and their food wholesome and such
as is proper for their condition, surely one
may boldly assert, that a family thus circumstanced
will have the fairest prospect
of enjoying good health.</p>

<p class='c008'>Having endeavoured to remove the prejudice
that is apt to accompany the idea of
an Hospital so far as relates to health, I
shall proceed to enumerate the advantages
that will most probably be obtained by an
institution of this kind; some of these
have been already mentioned in the translation,
and I shall take the liberty of introducing
them again in this place, with
little variation, as they relate to the subject.</p>

<p class='c008'>One, and indeed no inconsiderable
advantage to be derived from a plan of this
sort will be, that all the patients being
collected together in one house, the physician
will be enabled to attend a great
number at the same time in a proper manner,
and can be particularly attentive to
such as may more immediately require his
assistance.</p>

<p class='c008'>And it is of no small importance to
those who are inoculated, that the necessary
regulations in respect to regimen, as well
as every other circumstance that requires
the physician’s attention, will be there properly
observed, and the necessary medicines
always at hand, with an able person
to direct the manner in which they ought to be
administered.</p>

<p class='c008'>There is likewise another advantage
obtained by this method, that with proper
caution the Small Pox will not be communicated
to others in the natural way of
infection.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is also an encouraging circumstance,
that an establishment of this sort will be
attended with less expence, in several particulars,
than any other Hospital.</p>

<p class='c008'>One physician will be able to superintend
the process of Inoculation in a very
great number of patients, provided he is
assisted by a resident apothecary to receive
his instruction, and to be at hand to assist
on extraordinary emergencies.</p>

<p class='c008'>Few drugs or medicines will be
wanted; the expence therefore on these articles
will be very trifling.</p>

<p class='c008'>Few attendants on the sick will be necessary,
and not so much as one under the
character of a nurse; for there will always
be a sufficient number of patients in so
good a state of health, as to be able to attend
on those who may require assistance;
and it should be one condition of their admittance,
that they should be willing to
assist others when able, as they would wish
to be attended themselves when they stand
in need of it; and if this injunction is
complied with, it may be expected that
there will be a sufficient number in a state
of health to perform this office for one
another. The doing the heavy and dirty
part of the work, the care of the children,
the attendance of those who may have the
disease more severely, and the business of
the kitchen, will doubtless require a proper
number of healthy maid-servants.</p>

<p class='c008'>In respect to diet, as it will be
chiefly of the vegetable and least expensive
kinds of food, this will be a very moderate
article in the œconomy of such an establishment.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c006'>On the Hospitals at Pancras.</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_1_0_8 c007'>The Hospitals for Small Pox in the
natural way and Inoculation were instituted
in 1746, and have been supported
by voluntary subscription.</p>

<p class='c008'>These Hospitals consist of two houses
at a sufficient distance from each other,
and in airy situations.</p>

<p class='c008'>That for preparing the patients for inoculation
at Pancras contains 100 beds;
and that for receiving them when the disease
appears, and for admitting those who
are seized with the Small Pox in the natural
way, in Cold Bath Fields, 130 beds.</p>

<p class='c008'>All who are destitute of friends or money
and are attacked with this disease, or
are desirous of being inoculated, if seven
years old or upwards, are proper objects of
this charity.</p>

<p class='c008'>Patients in the natural way are received
every day, if there is room for them;
and to prevent the danger and expence of
a disappointment, enquiry should be first
made. Patients for Inoculation are also
received every day at Pancras before nine
in the morning.</p>

<p class='c008'>Strangers are forbid to visit the patients.</p>

<p class='c008'>Cloaths are provided for the patients,
while their own cloaths are freed from infection
before their discharge.</p>

<p class='c008'>As the first outline of every attempt
towards a new institution has for the most
part been imperfect, it is not to be wondered
at if the plan and regulations of
these Hospitals should admit of improvements;
and the following remarks will
perhaps point out some regulations that deserve
attention.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is now near thirty years since the first
establishment of this charity; at which
time it was the received opinion that a
strict regimen ought to be observed, and a
course of medicine complied with, by way
of preparing the most healthy previous to
their Inoculation. It was also believed,
that there was some risque of taking the
natural infection injuriously at the time of
being inoculated, and danger of accumulation
by residing with others who had the
disease; and the inoculators of that time
who made use of infected thread and lint,
sometimes failed infecting on the first trial,
and in such case the patient would probably
catch the natural distemper by cohabiting
with the sick.</p>

<p class='c008'>These opinions, it is presumed, joined
with the design of admitting patients in
the natural Small Pox, determined the first
Governors to have two Hospitals; one, to
contain all such who were actually undergoing
the disease in either way, and in a
state to infect others: the other to be appropriated
to such only who were under
preparation, or having been inoculated had
as yet no appearance of the usual eruptive
symptoms, and were not in a condition to
infect one another. But these opinions
have not been verified by experience; on
the contrary, it has turned out that the
precautions were not necessary. Experience
assures us, that a person in good
health may be safely inoculated without
any preparation, and that all the regulations
in respect to diet and the necessary
course of medicine, may be sufficiently
complied with in the week that intervenes
between the operation and the commencement
of the disease. With respect to a
double infection, that is, by Inoculation
and in the usual course of communication,
or an accumulation of the distemper afterwards
by living with those who are actually
labouring under it, no ill consequence need
be feared; for I am perfectly satisfied, that
after Inoculation is effectually performed,
no injury can be sustained by living with
others in the most infectious state. And
even if the first Inoculation should fail infecting
(which if proper care is taken will
scarce ever happen) the failure may be
discovered on the third or fourth day, and
the patient may be inoculated again; and
even then, should there be a moral certainty
that the natural infection has been
taken, it will be in time to prevent any ill
effects; the inoculated disease will as it
were supercede and annihilate the former
infection, and the patient have the Small
Pox from Inoculation only.</p>

<p class='c008'>I am aware that some apology is necessary
on publishing opinions that may be
deemed improbable in so laconic a manner;
this is no place to pursue the subject:
but I mean soon to support these assertions
by relating certain facts on which they are
founded. It is probable, that from a deliberate
consideration of these circumstances,
some considerable improvements may be
made in the regulations of the Hospital.</p>

<p class='c008'>A principal one should be, to quit the
practice of bringing the inoculated patients
to reside with those who have the natural
disease; a circumstance that could not have
been consented to but from the former mistaken
opinions which have been noticed.
A considerable advantage will also be gained
to the œconomy of the Hospital, on account
of the time of the patients residence
being shortened; by which means a greater
number may be inoculated at the same expence.</p>

<p class='c008'>I hope to stand excused from having
made these remarks here, as in the sequel
I mean to propose an enlargement of the
Hospital at Pancras.</p>

<p class='c008'>Having taken notice of the most material
articles that have occurred relative to
this subject, I shall venture, though with
much diffidence, to submit some outlines
of an Hospital for Inoculation to the public,
premising, that in respect to situation,
the environs of London do not seem to
afford a better spot than that on which the
inoculating Hospital at Pancras is built,
which, with the ground adjoining to it
being four acres, is sufficient for the accommodation
of any number of patients
for the benefit of the air; in short, every
local advantage would be there enjoyed in
great perfection: the present building is
not however capacious enough for such a
purpose, but it may be enlarged, and the
whole extent of ground ought to be walled
in, to prevent all intercourse with others,
or giving any offence to the public; and I
have not the least doubt of the acquiescence
and assistance of the present governors, to
any scheme for the extension of this noble
and useful charity, as they have, with a
most distinguished application and disinterestedness,
employed their best endeavours
to promote the interest of the present
establishment.</p>

<p class='c008'>But previous to every other step, an
application to Parliament for encouragement,
and proper powers to carry this
design into execution, seems necessary; for
it will not be sufficient to open an Hospital
for Inoculation, without offering something
as an inducement to invite those
who are proper objects to accept of the
benefits intended. Amongst the lower classes
of people in the metropolis, as well as in
many other places, the voice of the generality
is against Inoculation; prejudices
are not easily removed; nor is it to be expected
that the many will attend to the advantages
that will result to their children,
unless some present benefits were to be
connected with them<a id='r4' /><a href='#f4' class='c012'><sup>[4]</sup></a>.</p>

<hr class='c013' />
<div class='footnote' id='f4'>
<p class='c008'><span class='label'><a href='#r4'>4</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>While the Empress was under Inoculation at
Sarsco-celo, some of the poor of the adjoining village
were also, on the encouragement she had given, inoculated.</p>

<p class='c008'>I remember the Empress said to me, with that vivacity
and liberality of sentiment for which she is remarkably
distinguished, “If I was to order the poor
of this neighbourhood to be inoculated, it would be
complied with, and be beneficial to them; but I love
to use persuasive means, rather than authority; on
this account I have advanced a rouble (about four shillings)
to each that would consent, and several have accepted
it and recovered; but I find they now talk of
raising the price to two roubles, which I must consent
to as a further encouragement, for I wish the practice
may be advanced by the mildest methods.”</p>
</div>
<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c008'>If parish officers were obliged by Act of
Parliament to apply to the Hospital for
the admission of every man or woman who
should either on their own account, or on
behalf of their children, express a desire
of being inoculated, and on their being
taken in to supply each with two new
shirts or shifts, and sign an obligation to
provide decent new cloathing for every one
on their receiving notice of their recovery
and time of dismission, and also to give a
small gratuity (suppose half a crown) to
every person of the age of          and
to the parents of every child, on producing
a certificate of their having behaved decently,
and complied with the rules of the
house, signed by the physician, it would
probably be a sufficient inducement, and
at the same time the fresh cloathing would
effectually prevent the spreading the disease
to others. And this could not be reasonably
deemed a hardship, since some of the
most respectable old Hospitals exact as
much on admission of parish patients<a id='r5' /><a href='#f5' class='c012'><sup>[5]</sup></a>.</p>

<hr class='c013' />
<div class='footnote' id='f5'>
<p class='c008'><span class='label'><a href='#r5'>5</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>At St. Thomas’s Hospital, every patient on admission
pays 2s. 6d. if clean, or 10s. 6d. if venereal;
and the overseer or churchwarden of the parish signs an
obligation that he will find clean body linen every week,
and pay four pence a day so long as he continues in the
Hospital, and receive him when discharged, or take
away the body, or pay the burial fees to the steward of
the Hospital, in case of death.</p>
</div>
<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c008'>It is scarcely to be doubted but that
Parliament would chearfully embrace a
plan of this nature, which has for its object
the preservation of the lives of the
poor, and carrying them and their children
safely through this terrible disease, without
endangering their neighbourhoods.</p>

<p class='c008'>Parishes would likewise find their account
in it: by a known moderate charge
they would be released from the contingent
great expence of maintaining many sick
families, occasionally afflicted with the
Small Pox in the natural way; oftentimes
to the great injury of trade and manufactures:
and this by a trifling advance to be
bestowed but once during the life of an
individual, who would be maintained about
three weeks without any further expence,
and return home to wear the cloaths they
had bestowed on him.</p>

<p class='c008'>Thus much I have thought necessary to
state, from a moral certainty that some provision
of this sort should be made; to proceed,
would be entering into minute matters
that would more properly belong to the
governors, who will be best able to make
such regulations as may be for the general
benefit of the charity.</p>

<p class='c008'>So much has already been said on general
Inoculations in the country, that it
seems unnecessary to enter on the subject
again in this place. But such is the obstinacy
of some parishes, and the parsimony
of others, that it is impossible for the poor
who are desirous of being inoculated, to
persuade them to advance the small sum
that would be necessary to defray the expence;
and they are therefore obliged to
wait the event of the natural disease, while
the principal inhabitants are securing their
own families by Inoculation.</p>

<p class='c008'>Another unjustifiable piece of frugality
that deserves attention and to be remedied
is, that in many places where the whole
number of poor have been inoculated at
the expence of the parish, illiterate fellows,
totally unacquainted with diseases or remedies,
have been employed on account of
cheapness only; when at the same time
the families of the wealthy have been
under the care of medical gentlemen of
good reputation. To insert all the instances
that might be produced of parochial
meanness would be tedious; I shall
mention the following only, which may
be relied on as an indisputable truth.
The inhabitants of a certain parish had a
meeting to agree on inoculating all the
poor; some medical gentlemen in the
neighbourhood offered to undertake the
business at a very low price; but as cheapness
was the only object of consideration,
the parish was about to agree with a blacksmith
at eighteen pence a head, when one
of the most frugal started this objection:
It is very probable that under this man’s
care we may have some die, and the expence
of their burial may cost the parish
so much, that it might be as well to agree
with a better man. This objection was thus
removed by the smith:—“Come, I’ll tell
you what I’ll do with you.—Give me half
a crown a head, and them that die I will
carry to the church-yard without putting
the parish to any further expence.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Thus to trifle with the lives of their
indigent fellow creatures, must be an indelible
reproach to any people. I know it
will be said, that many instances can be
produced, where whole parishes of poor
have been inoculated, and have succeeded
very well, under the care of persons who
were totally unacquainted with medicine.</p>

<p class='c008'>I will not here dispute the truth of this
assertion; and indeed, if it was not an
easy matter to procure more able help, it
might be better to continue the practice in
that way than to neglect inoculating entirely;
but this is not the case. Gentlemen
of the profession of good abilities will
go very low in their price; and when it is
considered that the sum is to be paid but
once in the life of each person, surely parishes
ought to be compelled to employ
one who has had a medical education, and
others should be restrained to their own
proper business.</p>

<p class='c008'>But it happens not unfrequently that
irregular and dangerous symptoms appear,
and at other times a different disease attacks
the patient at the same time, with some
unusual complaints while under Inoculation;
these situations would certainly require
the assistance of a person who could
judge well of the symptoms, and distinguish
the diseases properly, and know how
to treat them, which a man unacquainted
with the principles or the practice of
physic could not pretend to, and consequently
the patient would be exposed to
great danger. Should an Act of Parliament
be procured, it would be necessary to
provide for the following circumstances.</p>

<p class='c008'>That every parish (with the exception
of such large places as should be thought
too populous to be included) should be
enjoined to offer Inoculation to all their
poor who should be willing to admit of
it<a id='r6' /><a href='#f6' class='c012'><sup>[6]</sup></a>; that the patients and their families
should be maintained during their illness;
that the person employed to inoculate
should have had some education in medicine
as physician, surgeon, or apothecary;
and that once in five years the same offer
should be renewed, leaving the time of
year and other circumstances to the option
of the parish.</p>

<hr class='c013' />
<div class='footnote' id='f6'>
<p class='c008'><span class='label'><a href='#r6'>6</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Vide Page 3, &amp;c.</p>
</div>
<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c008'>If these obligatory clauses were obtained,
general Inoculations in the country might
be carried on at a very moderate expence.</p>

<div class='pbb'>
 <hr class='pb c010' />
</div>
<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c006'>CONCLUSION.</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_1_0_8 c007'>On a review of what has been advanced
it will appear, that the practice of
Inoculation has been upon the whole rather
hurtful than advantageous to the city
of London, and that the mortality from
Small Pox has lately increased to an alarming
degree: that it may be presumed this
loss has not been sustained by the wealthy,
who have availed themselves of their easy
circumstances, and by timely Inoculation
have secured their families; but that the
loss has fallen principally among those who
are not the least useful members of the
community, viz. on young persons, the
offspring of inferior trades-people, and the
labouring poor.</p>

<p class='c008'>It has been shewn, that to encourage
partial Inoculations among such of the
poor as might be willing to accept the offer,
and should be found in a proper state of
health, would be to increase the evil, by
spreading the disease in a destructive manner
among their neighbours, and be on
other accounts dangerous and intolerable.
An hospital for the purpose of Inoculation
<i>only</i> has been rescued from the unjust
charge of being unhealthy, and has been
proved to enjoy superior advantages in that
respect, and many others; and that a well-regulated
plan of this kind would effectually
answer the purposes of abating the
mortality, and securing the community
from being infected by the patients.</p>

<p class='c008'>An application therefore to the Legislature
for approbation and assistance seems
highly expedient; and it is not to be
doubted but the generous and humane
would readily be induced to raise by subscription
a fund sufficient to carry these
good designs into execution; so that as we
are the first European nation who received
and encouraged Inoculation, we may also
have the honour of being the first who
have generously diffused the benefit of it to
the community at large, and transmitted
it to posterity.</p>

<p class='c008'>We have thus far only taken into consideration
what respects the two extremes of
society, the opulent and indigent; but
there still remains a numerous and respectable
part of the community unnoticed, I
mean, persons who are in but moderate
circumstances, yet above accepting the charity
of an hospital.</p>

<p class='c008'>Persons thus circumstanced seem to have
a claim upon the humanity of such practitioners
as are eminent in their profession;
who, from that motive, we doubt not,
will chearfully give their attendance on
such terms as families can afford. By this
well-timed generosity, the minds of the
middle rank of people will be made easy,
and it will be a great inducement for them
also to inoculate their families.</p>

<p class='c008'>To conclude, I have used my best endeavours
to represent the whole that has
been treated of in its true light, and recommended
the methods that have seemed
to me to answer the purposes most effectually.
It may probably happen, that zeal
in the cause may have carried me too far,
or that through inadvertency some errors
may have been made. If they are pointed
out, I will acknowledge them with thanks
to the informer, having nothing more in
view than the good of the public, and
that the practice recommended may be so
conducted as to afford its opposers as few
objections, on any solid ground, as possible.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is so truly the cause of humanity,
and so certain of answering the purpose,
that I most earnestly recommend a liberal
support to all charitably disposed persons,
and more especially to such in affluent
circumstances, who may have experienced
the happy effects of Inoculation in their
own families, concluding with the words
constantly used by a beggar in Turky,</p>
